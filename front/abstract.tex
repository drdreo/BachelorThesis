\chapter{Abstract}

\begin{english}
	Webcomponents aim towards atomarizing web programming by giving developers the possibility to extend already exisitng HTML elemnts and to create own components. This modest addition enables programmers to build their software out of combined, powerfull components.
	This bachelor thesis focuses on the development of a framework of web components in combination with other popular web technologies to develop a server application using webcomponents. This framework will then be evaluated based on a prototype implemented as a project in the fifth semester.
